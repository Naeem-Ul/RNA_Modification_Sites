Requirements:

We have tested our code on the following platform.
Python 3.6
Tensorflow 1.7.0
Keras 2.2.5


Testing the Model:

The trained models are saved in the ¡°output¡± folder
Put the test files in the folder named  ¡°./folds¡± in npy format
Run the Test.py file for testing.
The test results are generated in the ¡°output¡± folder


Training the Model:

To train the model on your dataset, first generate the Training, Validation, and Testing files using the file data_generate.py
Run the Gen_seq_clas_Train.py file to train the model.
The trained model weights will be saved in the ¡°output¡± folder
Test the model using the above approach
